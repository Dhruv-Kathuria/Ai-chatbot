Defining elements of this educational approach require that students engage in authentic and meaningful\nwork-related tasks and must involve three stakeholders: the student, the university, and the workplace/community.\n(2) WIL may encompass a range of models and approaches to learning and assessment with discipline theory,\nknowledge, and skills as an integral part of program and course design. \n(3) WIL provides the opportunity for students to gain professional and/or vocational experience in their chosen field by\ncompleting approved activities that, when successfully completed, count towards their program of study.\n(4) The Program and Course requirements duplicate Program and Course Policy  content, with minor editorial changes.\nDetails are subject to review 12 months from the effective date of this procedure.\nSection 2 - Authority\n(5) Authority for this document is established by the Program and Course Policy .\nSection 3 - Scope\n(6) This procedure applies to all work integrated learning courses offered by RMIT Group institutions.\n(7) WIL does not include:\nhigher degrees by researcha.\napprenticeships and traineeshipsb.\nguest lecturers from industry, government, or communityc.\nwork experience as co-curricular activities, ord.\nany other non-assessed activities.  e.\nSection 4 - Procedure\nOverview\n(8) WIL activities must: \nintegrate theoretical learning with practical application in professional contexts that engage students ina.\nmeaningful and consequential learning activities \nbe integrated throughout the program to enable students to achieve course and program learning outcomes,b.\nThis document may be varied, withdrawn or replaced at any time.

Industry engaged projects commonly\nrequire teams or individual students to undertake a real project that is based on real problems or address needs of\nindustry or community.  Industry partners are engaged in the project and provide feedback to students.\n(15) Industry engaged WIL projects may be paid or unpaid. They may take place on campus, off campus, offshore or\nonline. \nSimulated Workplace Environments\n(16) WIL activities in simulated workplace environments may be necessary for ethical, safety or professional reasons\nor when other forms of industry engaged WIL are unavailable.\n(17) These environments are designed to simulate real workplaces in their function, equipment and mode of operation\nso that students can experience a variety of scenarios and inter-related activities similar to real work experience in the\nindustry or profession to which the program leads.\n(18) This type of WIL can occur face-to-face or online, on campus or off campus, and is usually unpaid.\nThis document may be varied, withdrawn or replaced at any time.

Occurs where more than one student contributes to an assessment\ntask that is submitted as the work of an individual student where the collaboration is not permitted\nfor the assessment task. Collusion may also occur in group work where unauthorised collaboration\noccurs between groups.\nContract cheating is the use of outsourced material for the purpose of submission by a student for assessment. The\nperson submitting the work is being dishonest by representing it as their own. This diﬀers from\ntraditional forms of plagiarism, which more commonly involves copying of existing submitted or\npublished work. Contract cheating can take on many forms and is not limited to the purchasing of\nassessment material from online sources. Students may obtain assessments from peers or ‘tutors’\nand the arrangement may not involve a ﬁnancial exchange. Signiﬁcantly, the submitted work is\nusually original in nature making it diﬃcult to detect using text matching plagiarism software.\nCopyingoccurs when paragraphs, sentences, a single sentence or signiﬁcant parts of a sentence, or the key\npoints or structure of another person’s work have been used in an assessment without\nacknowledging the source.\nFabricationoccurs when a student claims to have carried out tests, experiments, research or observations that\nhave not taken place.\nFalsiﬁcationinvolves the misrepresentation of research data, source material or results, or the presentation of\nresults that are not supported by the evidence.\nImpersonationinvolves the completion and submission of an assessment task by another person that dishonestly\nmisrepresents themselves as the person to whom the assessment task was assigned. Impersonation\ncan also take place in the context of invigilated assessment wherein a person completes the\nassessment on behalf of another whilst dishonestly misrepresenting their identity.\nPlagiarismthe presentation of the work, idea or creation of another person as though it is one’s own. Plagiarism\nis a form of cheating and is a serious academic oﬀence that may lead to expulsion from the\nUniversity. Plagiarised material can be drawn from, and presented in, written, graphic or visual form,\nincluding electronic data, and oral presentations. Plagiarism occurs when the origin of the material\nused is not appropriately cited.\nThis document may be varied, withdrawn or replaced at any time.
